# telescope-frecency.nvim

A [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) extension that offers intelligent prioritization when selecting files from your editing history.

Using an implementation of Mozilla's [Frecency algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm) (used in [Firefox's address bar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/address-bar-autocomplete-firefox)), files edited _frecently_ are given higher precedence in the list index.

As the extension learns your editing habits over time, the sorting of the list is dynamically altered to priotize the files you're likely to need.

* _Scores shown in finder for demonstration purposes - disabled by default_

## Frecency: Sorting by 'frequency' _and_ 'recency'

'Frecency' is a score given to each unique file indexed in a file history database.

A timestamp is recorded once per session when a file is first loaded into a buffer.

The score is calculated using the age of the 10 most recent timestamps and the total amount of times that the file has been loaded:

### Recency values (per timestamp)

| Timestamp age | Value |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 hours  | 100        |
| 1 day    | 80         | 
| 3 days   | 60         | 
| 1 week   | 40         | 
| 1 month  | 20         | 
| 90 days  | 10         | 

### Score calculation

```
score = frequency * recency_score / max_number_of_timestamps
```

### Workspace Filters

The _Workspace filter_ feature enables you to select from user defined _filter tags_ that map to a directory or collection of directories.

When a filter is applied, results are reduced to entries whose path is a descendant of the workspace directory.
The indexed results are optionally augmented with a listing of _all_ files found in a recurssive search of the workspace directory.
Unindexed files are given a score of zero and appear below the 'frecent' entries.

## Requirements

- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) (required)
- [sql.nvim](https://github.com/tami5/sql.nvim) (required)

Timestamps and file records are stored in an [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database for persistence and speed.
This plugin uses `sql.nvim` to perform the database transactions.

## Installation

### [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) 

```lua
use {
  "nvim-telescope/telescope-frecency.nvim",
  config = function()
    require"telescope".load_extension("frecency")
  end
}
```

_TODO: add installation instructions for other package managers_

If no database is found when running Neovim with the plugin installed, a new one is created and entries from `shada` `v:oldfiles` are automatically imported.

## Usage

```
:Telescope frecency
```
..or to map to a key:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<leader><leader>", "<Cmd>lua require('telescope').extensions.frecency.frecency()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
```
Filter tags are applied by typing the `:tag:` name (adding surrounding colons) in the finder query.
Entering `:<Tab>` will trigger omnicompletion for available tags.

## Configuration

See [default configuration](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#telescope-defaults) for full details on configuring Telescope.

- `ignore_patterns`

This setting controls which files are indexed (and subsequently which you'll see in the finder results).

- `show_scores`

To see the scores generated by the algorithm in the results, set this to `true`.


If you've not configured the extension, the following values are used: 

```
telescope.setup {
  extensions = {
    frecency = {
      show_scores = false,
      ignore_patterns = {"*.git/*", "*/tmp/*"},
      workspaces = {
        ["conf"]    = "/home/my_username/.config",
        ["data"]    = "/home/my_username/.local/share",
        ["project"] = "/home/my_username/projects",
        ["wiki"]    = "/home/my_username/wiki"
      }
    }
  },
}
```

### Highlight Groups

```vim
TelescopePathSeparator
TelescopeBufferLoaded
```
